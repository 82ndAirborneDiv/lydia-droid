                <p>For a more complete picture of your patient’s
                    health, the CDC has created the Taking a Sexual History guide. The guide offers parameters
                    for discussion of sexual health issues. A sexual
                    history needs to be taken during a patient’s
                    initial visit, during routine preventive exams,
                    and when you see signs of sexually transmitted
                    diseases (STDs). The dialogue lends itself to the
                    opportunity for risk-reduction counseling and
                    sharing information about behaviors that may
                    place your patient at risk of contracting STDs.
                    A sexual history allows you to identify those
                    individuals at risk for STDs, including HIV, and
                    to identify appropriate anatomical sites for
                    certain STD tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The guide was created to help you
                    determine the STD's risk among your
                    patients. The impact of STDs on a
                    patient’s health can range from irritating
                    to life threatening. Sexual health can greatly
                    impact overall quality of life.
